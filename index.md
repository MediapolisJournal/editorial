## Editorial Policy and Submission Guidelines

Mediapolis is an editorially- and peer-reviewed, middle-state, open-access online journal that supports critical inquiries into the relationship of media and cities, broadly defined. We welcome submissions on topics ranging from architecture as media, to digital outcroppings of the urban, to restorations of movie palaces. As a middle-state journal, we are especially interested in “small-gauge” original criticism that engages very recent texts and events, reviews of new work or trends in the field, original research in the early stages of progress, reports on conferences, workshops of pedagogy materials, and roundtables with participants in collaborative projects such as conference panels or edited anthologies.

Recurring features and publishing categories on the site include: 
- “Footnote,” interesting tangents that didn’t fit into completed projects, new directions inspired by the conclusions of such projects. 1,000-1,500 words. Peer reviewed.
- “Thread,” 3-4 participants in a recently completed or upcoming project conduct a moderated email exchange around one topic that relates to the project, which will be lightly edited for clarity and posted to the site.
- “Conference Report,” an attendee at a conference provides a brief reflection on the event. We are especially interested in one-off conferences and in reports from writers attending conferences that fall outside of their home discipline. 700-1,000 words.
- “Trends,” book reviews of work that falls into the intersection of media and urban studies, or essays reflecting on recent recurring trends in the field. 1,000-1,500 words. Peer reviewed.
- “Syllabus Corner,” syllabi in progress or for completed courses, posted with a brief introductory reflection of 500-700 words. A comment-centric feature.
- “Deep Dives,” original research or criticism of texts and objects, including both data gathering and close analysis for projects in the early stages and critiques of recent films, series, or other media/events. 2,000-2,500 words. Peer reviewed.
- “Upon Further Consideration,” podcasts in which authors update, reflect upon, and continue their work from a submitted Footnote, Deep Dive, or Trend piece.

All content must conform to the Chicago Manual of Style note and bibliography system (16th ed.). Contributors are encouraged to employ the online format creatively through use of multi-media content or extensions.
